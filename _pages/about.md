## **Welcome!**  
I'm David, a third-year undergraduate studying **Electrical and Computer Engineering** at **Seoul National University**. I'm passionate about solving novel, real-world challenges with ML/DL. My current research primarily explores **generative AI**, with my recent work focusing on reframing real videos using video diffusion models. 


## **Research Experience**  

### **Undergraduate Research Intern**  
üìç [Intelligent Computing Lab (ICL)](https://icl.snu.ac.kr) | *Dec. 2023 ‚Äì May 2025* |
Advisor: [Se Young Chun](https://icl.snu.ac.kr/pi)
- Developed a principled method to control the *framing* of generated videos in **video motion transfer** pipelines using video diffusion models. Our approach enables object repositioning, camera zoom adjustments, and perspective shifts.  
- Our [paper](https://dg-lee23.github.io/principled-reframing-project-page/) is currently under review for ICCV 2025.  

### **Undergraduate Research Intern**  
üìç [MDILRG](https://sites.google.com/site/donghwanleehome/home) | *June 2023 ‚Äì Aug. 2023* | 
Advisor: [Dong Hwan Lee](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/professor/17375/)  
- Proposed a reinforcement learning-based algorithm for PID controller tuning, ensuring stability throughout training. Our method outperforms traditional approaches in PID gain tuning while maintaining safety constraints.  
- Our [paper](https://www.dbpia.co.kr/journal/articleDetail?nodeId=NODE11554762) was presented at [The 4th Korea Artificial Intelligence Conference](https://2023.koreaai.org/) and received the Excellent Paper Award.
