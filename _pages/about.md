## **Welcome!**  
I'm David, a third-year undergraduate studying **Electrical and Computer Engineering** at **Seoul National University**. I'm passionate about solving novel, real-world challenges with ML/DL. My current research primarily explores **generative AI**, with my recent work focusing on reframing real videos using video diffusion models.

## **Research Experience**  

### **Undergraduate Research Intern**  
📍 [**Intelligent Computing Lab (ICL)**](https://icl.snu.ac.kr) | **Dec. 2023 – May 2025**  
**Advisor:** [Se Young Chun](https://icl.snu.ac.kr/pi) | **Mentor:** [Seong Min Hong](https://smhongok.github.io/)  
- Developed a principled method to control the *framing* of generated videos in **video motion transfer** pipelines using video diffusion models.  
- Our approach enables object repositioning, camera zoom adjustments, and perspective shifts.  
- Our paper is currently under review for ICCV 2025.  

### **Undergraduate Research Intern**  
📍 [**MDILRG**](https://sites.google.com/site/donghwanleehome/home) | **June 2023 – Aug. 2023**  
**Advisor:** [Dong Hwan Lee](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/professor/17375/)  
- Proposed a reinforcement learning-based algorithm for PID controller tuning, ensuring stability throughout training.  
- Our method outperforms traditional approaches in PID gain tuning while maintaining safety constraints.  
- Our [paper](https://www.dbpia.co.kr/journal/articleDetail?nodeId=NODE11554762) was presented at 제4회 한국 인공지능 학술대회 and received the Excellent Paper Award.
